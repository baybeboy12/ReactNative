// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.
var wM = 95
var hM = 1.88
var bmiM = wM / (hM ** 2)
var wJ = 85
var hJ = 1.76
var bmiJ = wJ / (hJ ** 2)
var markHigherBMI = bmiM > bmiJ
